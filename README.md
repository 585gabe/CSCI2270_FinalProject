# CSCI-2270-Final-Project
Summary:
This program will replicate the WWII German Enigma Cipher Machine. I will use a linked list to keep track of the rotor replacements. I will include the default rotors that the Germans used along with an option to generate random rotors using some new C++ random libraries. The machine is fairly hard to explain, so if you wish to read more about it here: http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm

How to Run:
Copy the repository to its own directory. Run ./Driver in the terminal, or alternatively compile it yourself by running:
make
and then ./Driver afterwards.

Dependencies:
None

System Requirements:
Any OS that runs C++ programs
