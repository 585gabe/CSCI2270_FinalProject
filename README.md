# CSCI-2270-Final-Project
Summary:
This program will replicate the WWII German Enigma Cipher Machine. I will use a linked list to keep track of the rotor replacements. I will include the default rotors that the Germans used along with an option to generate random rotors using some new C++ random libraries. The machine is fairly hard to explain, so if you wish to read more about it here: http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm

How to Run:
**PLEASE MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR INPUTS ARE CAPITAL LETTERS. SPACES ARE OKAY.**
Copy the repository to its own directory. Run ./Driver in the terminal, or alternatively compile it yourself by running:
make
and then ./Driver afterwards.
The Driver runs the whole program and main!

Dependencies:
None

System Requirements:
Any OS that runs C++ programs

Group Members:
Oliver Hanna

Improvements:
For those who want to add to the program it currently does not support
any lowercase inputs. There are also almost no safeguards to check for punctuation or odd inputs (like numbers). These have the potential to break the program.
Adding safeguards to prevent the program from crashing and adding lowercase support are both possible TO-DO's.
